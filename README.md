# Tournament Allocator

This project is designed to allocate teams to courts for a tournament, supporting both pool play and single elimination formats. It provides a structured way to manage tournament logistics, ensuring that teams are allocated to courts according to specified constraints.

## 🆕 Client-Side Version Available!

A new **standalone HTML application** is now available that runs entirely in the browser with no backend required! Perfect for:
- Quick tournament setup without server infrastructure
- Offline tournament management  
- Easy deployment (just open the HTML file!)
- Privacy-focused data handling (data never leaves your browser)

**See [`CLIENT-SIDE-README.md`](CLIENT-SIDE-README.md) for details and [`tournament-allocator.html`](tournament-allocator.html) to get started!**

## Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd python-tournament-allocator
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**:
   Ensure you have Python installed, then run:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Prepare data files**:
   - Populate `data/teams.csv` with the names and attributes of the teams.
   - Populate `data/courts.csv` with the names and start times of the courts.
   - Define allocation constraints in `data/constraints.json`.

## Running the Application

To run the tournament allocation script, execute the following command in your terminal:
```
python src/main.py
```

Follow the prompts to input the necessary data and view the allocation results.

## Overview of Tournament Allocation Process

The allocation process involves:
- Reading team and court data from CSV files.
- Applying constraints defined in the JSON file.
- Allocating teams to courts based on the selected tournament format (pool play or single elimination).
- Outputting the results of the allocation.

This project aims to streamline the organization of tournaments, making it easier for organizers to manage teams and courts effectively.
