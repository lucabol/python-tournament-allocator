# DISABLED: Azure deployment workflow
# 
# This workflow is disabled because the application is running on Azure B1 tier,
# which does not support deployment slots. The workflow was designed to use
# deployment slots for zero-downtime deployments, but B1 tier limitations
# prevent this feature from working.
#
# To re-enable: Remove the comment markers below and uncomment the full workflow.
# Consider this only if the app is upgraded to a higher tier (Standard or Premium)
# that supports deployment slots.
